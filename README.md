This project explores democratizing produce waste reduction using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and machine learning to predict fruit and vegetable ripeness. By leveraging an economical approach—combining infrared (IR) filters with smartphone cameras—the study builds on prior research to develop a cost-effective solution accessible to consumers. A machine learning model trained on spectral and RGB images predicts tomato firmness with a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between 2.8 and 3.1 Newtons. Additionally, an iPhone app was developed to analyze tomato ripeness and guide users to nearby food banks for donations, providing a scalable, non-destructive, and affordable method to reduce food waste at consumer, retail, and supplier levels.
